-- Feature 8. Check for past due account and charge a late fee. There is no input. The feature checks for each account and see whether the balance is still positive if the current date is after the due date of the most recent monthly bill. If so, the account is past due and a 5% late charge is added to the account balance. Please also insert a message into message table stating that the account is past due.
