--Feature 15: Do a comparative study for a customer. The input is the account number, the year and month. Report the electricity and gas usage of the customer for that month, the usage of the customer for the same month last year, and the average usage of all customers in the same zip code, the average usage of the bottom 20% of houses in the same zip code. You can call feature 13 to get the average usage and bottom 20% usage.

/*
First , we retrieve the electricity and gas usage for a certain a customer for a specific year. 
Then we get the the usage for the given account in the previous year. 
The count variable indicates if the account has electricity and gas usage in the previous.
if it's bigger than 0 then it means the account has usage information last year. 
Else an exception will be occurred , that means this account did not have usage information the previous year and a message will be displayed that this account don't have usage information the previous year . 
A message will be displayed to indicate this information. After this we call Feature 13 to get average usage(both Electricity and Gas) for a certain Zipcode.
In addition,we will get the house with least usage(20%). If there are houses in the zipcode (not null) 
then it will be displayed.Otherwise, if there are no houses a message will be displayed that the average could not be computed
