The balance of the account will be reduced by that amount. Please also insert a message into message table stating payment received and payment amount.

cust_id integer; -- this will hold the customer id that we will get from the given account number
message varchar(255); -- this will hold the message to be inserted into the message table
begin
select customerID into cust_id from account where accountid = account_id; -- this will get the customer id for the entered account id
	insert into payment values (pay_sequence.nextval, cust_id, account_id, sysdate, amt, method); -- a payment has been recorded into the payment table with customer id, account id and the amount paid
	update account set balance = balance - amt where accountid = account_id; --the balance in the account table has been updated with the difference of the amount paid
  insert into message values (msg_sequence.nextval, account_id, 'Payment Received : $'||amt, sysdate); -- a message has been inserted into the message table with the account id and the amount paid
  	dbms_output.put_line('The payment has been successfully received!');

exception
